JSMF - JavaScript State Management Framework

NOTE: This project was originally created in 2004.  It's no longer being
actively maintained as MANY mature JS frameworks have come along that
probably eliminate the need for client->server side persistence like this.
But, it's here for historical purposes and free to be used as a reference
point for Javascript-based APIs.

   What is JSMF?

   JSMF (JavaScript State Management Framework) provides your web-based
   applications with a comprehensive mechanism to maintain state. This
   solution is made possible by utilizing frames (standard and inline),
   forms, DHTML and an OO (object oriented) JavaScript API. The API
   provides a standardized way to read, write, and persist session data.
